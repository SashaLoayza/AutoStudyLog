A macro-packed spreadsheet that facilitates fast and accurate documentation of your study sessions, with long-term sessions auto-formatted for clear readability. Comes with a data view for long-term comparisons of self-ratings, time spent per discipline type, and more! 

Consult the AutoStudyLog.xlsm for a blank log with one task that explains the workings of the sheet. Check out the Semester1CompositionSpreadsheet for a working example (my own studies).
